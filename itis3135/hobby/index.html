                <h2>About Cooking</h2>
                <p class="definition">I have always been interested in cooking ever since I got into high school. My high school had a culinary class, but unfortunately I wasn't able to take it. This led me to cooking on my own, trying out new recipies that I found on the internet and trying to create my own foods.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Cooking became a way for me to relieve some stress, whether it was from school, work, or other things. The good thing about cooking is that there is a tasty reward after putting in all your efforts. You also get to share the food to family to try, which always feels nice when they enjoy the food.</p>

            <section id="when">
                <h2>Best times to Cook!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early in the morning: Usually cooking while the sun is coming up is really refreshing since the sun kind of wakes you up.</li>
                    <li>Late at night: Sometimes making a midnight snack is a nice way to end off the day.</li>
                    <li>With Friends! Cooking with friends always makes it more enjoyable and a memorable experience.</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>
                <p>The fun part of cooking is that there are different types of meal depending on the time you a eating, for instance breakfast foods are much more different than dinner foods. This image was able to depict the feeling and scenary of this perfectly</p>

                <h2>Where do I Cook?</h2>
                <p class="definition">I usually cook in my kitchen at home since I am a commuter, but occassionally I will cook at my friends house usually bake something together. My kitchen isn't the biggest or most aestetic, but it gets the job done still.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>My kitchen is a bit small, but it has all the essentials that I need to cook a meal. I have a stove, oven, microwave, and a fridge. I also have a few pots and pans that I use to cook my meals. I also have a few spices that I use to season my food. In the early morning it also looks really nice because there is a window on the right where the sun shines through.</p>
