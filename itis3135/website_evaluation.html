                <h3><a href="https://www.google.com/" class="website">Google.com</a></h3>
                <p>Google’s website is iconic for its extreme simplicity and focus on search functionality. It uses a clean design with minimal distractions, allowing users to focus on their search queries.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Google uses strong contrast with a stark white background and its colorful logo and dark text, making the search bar the clear focal point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site uses consistent fonts, button styles, and layouts across pages, reinforcing usability and familiarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All elements are centrally aligned, creating a balanced and uncluttered layout that draws the user’s eye to the search bar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements like the search bar and buttons are grouped logically, maintaining a clean and intuitive structure that supports quick interaction.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
    
            <section class="left">
                <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/" class="website">Craigslist.com</a></h3>
                <p>Craigslist’s website is famous (or infamous) for its ultra-minimal, barebones design that prioritizes function over aesthetics.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="Crap"><strong>Contrast:</strong> Craigslist has very low visual contrast. Most of the text is the same size and color, with minimal use of color or visual hierarchy to distinguish important elements.</li>
                    <li class="Crap"><strong>Repetition:</strong> Repetition exists, but mostly because the design hasn’t changed in decades. Fonts, links, and layout are consistent—though that consistency feels more like stagnation than intentional branding.</li>
                    <li class="Crap"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment is basic and sometimes awkward. Elements are loosely structured in columns and lists, but the lack of visual refinement makes the layout feel cluttered and unbalanced.</li>
                    <li class="Crap"><strong>Proximity:</strong> Proximity is one of the weaker points. Links and categories are densely packed, with minimal spacing or visual grouping, making it hard to scan or find what you need quickly.</li>
                </ul>
